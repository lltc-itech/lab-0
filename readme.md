# Instructions  

For this lab, you will create a very simple web page. It doesn't have to be good. It doesn't even have to really use HTML. This is more about getting used to using repl.it than anything else. We are mostly just here to make sure that we (including me) all understand how to use the platform.

So, for this lab, use the provided file `index.html` to try out some HTML. Create a page about a hobby of yours. Just two or three paragraphs.

So far, we have covered a few tags, but let's keep it realatively simple. Definitely try to use the `<p>` tag to create paragraphs. Also, be sure to add a `<title>` at the top of your page. If you are feeling confident, add a DOCTYPE declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, but don't go too much further than that.

See the example file if you need any inspiration.
