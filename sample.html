<title>Boardgames!</title>

<p>My name is Eric and I really enjoy boardgames. In particular, I like high end euro-style board games with interesting themes. Lately, my favorite board game has been one called Oath, by Cole Wehrle.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating game because every time you play it, it changes a little bit. The victory conditions will be different from one game to the next. There may be new cards in the deck or some will have been removed. The game board itself will have different areas to explore and new political intrigues to develop.</p>

<p>At its core it's a game about political intrigue, as one player is the chancellor for the game, and all of the other players must oppose them or try to curry favor and win a joint victory with the chancellor. How that all plays out is very different from game to game, and the repurcussions of any individual playthrough will be felt in future games.</p>

<p>It's very fun!</p>
